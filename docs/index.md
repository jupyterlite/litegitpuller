# litegitpuller

A Jupyterlab/jupyterlite extension to fetch github repositories.

As for [nbgitpuller](https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller), information about the repository to fetch has to be set in the URL.

```{eval-rst}
.. jupyterlite::
   :width: 100%
   :height: 600px
   :prompt: Try JupyterLite!
   :prompt_color: #00aa42
   :search_params: ["branch", "repo", "urlpath"]
```

## Parameters

The parameters to provide must be formatted as in `nbgitpuller`.\
They can be generated with [nbgitpuller link generator](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/link.html).

Currently the allowed parameters are:

- `repo`: the github repository to fetch
- `branch`: the branch of the repository to fetch
- `urlpath`: the path to a notebook file to open (relative to the root of the repository).

## Limitations

Fetching a repository uses the unauthenticated Github API to fetch each file, with a capacity of 60 files per hour
see [github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#rate-limits-for-requests-from-personal-accounts).

Do not expect to fetch a large repository with it.

## Try it

It can be tried with the current documentation, by providing parameters in the current URL of the documentation.

As an example the following URL will reload the current page with some repo parameters:\

<a href="https://litegitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrichet%2Ftesting-repo&urlpath=tree%2Ftesting-repo%2Fnotebooks%2Fsimple.ipynb&branch=main">

</a>
